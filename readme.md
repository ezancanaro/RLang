# Tutorial Implementation of an Interpreter for a Reversible Language

Haskell implementation of an interpreter for a functional reversible language, proposed by [Yokoyama et. al](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2238538).
The interpreter was built as an exploration on reversible languages without thinking about optimizations.

There is no dependency, the project can be compiled simply by: ghc Main.hs

Things that could benefit the project:
 - Specify formal codes for other types like Char, Bool or Float.
 - Specify more complex programs. (Made easier by a parser).
 - Build a Syntax-Parser.
